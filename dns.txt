For dns-clients/hosts which need to point to dns-servers. Use either /etc/resolv.conf but that would be overwritten on bootup, or add following line in /etc/network/interfaces
dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8
In order to see changes do ifup and ifdown
(
Above will do it, if not, try following too
systemctl restart networking
systemctl restart network-manager
resolvconf -u (this updates own database)
resolvconf -d enp0s8 (updates - automatically happens when you do ifdown/ifup)
)

To install dns server. 
sudo apt-get install bind9

To set up caching server(whatever that means)
(I think by default it's working as caching server and nothing needs to be done as the response for command 'dig @localhost google.com' remains same, but following is what manual says)
sudo vim /etc/bind/named.conf.options
(add following lines)
listen-on port 53 { any; };
allow-query {any;};
recursion yes;
(It didn't work on vagrant vm(precise) but worked on xenial)

Authoritative Forward Zone (Worked at vagrant vm)
"
• 30 second TTL
• www.example.com has the address 192.168.111.45 and the IPv6 address fe80::22c9:d0ff:1ecd:c0ef
• foo.example.com has the address 192.168.121.11
• bar.example.com has a CNAME pointing to www.example.com
• host1.example.com through host100.example.com have the addresses 10.20.45.1 through 10.20.45.100
"

Add following to /etc/bind/named.conf.local
zone "example.com." {
        type master;
        file "/etc/bind/example.com.zone";
};

Create following file /etc/bind/example.com.zone
$TTL    30
@       IN      SOA     localhost. root.example.com. (
                              1         ; Serial
                         604800         ; Refresh
                          86400         ; Retry
                        2419200         ; Expire
                         604800 )       ; Negative Cache TTL
@       IN      NS      localhost.
www.example.com.        IN      A       192.168.111.45
www.example.com.        IN      AAAA    fe80::22c9:d0ff:1ecd:c0ef
foo.example.com.        IN      A       192.168.121.11
bar.example.com.        IN      CNAME   www.example.com.
$GENERATE 1-100 host$.example.com.      IN      A       10.20.45.$

Check the syntax using following command
sudo named-checkconf -z

In order to test it use following commands. 
dig @localhost -t A www.example.com
dig @localhost -t AAAA www.example.com
dig @localhost -t A foo.example.com
dig @localhost -t CNAME bar.example.com
dig @localhost -t A host7.example.com
dig @localhost -t A host27.example.com

Reverse DNS zone for 10.20.45.0/255.255.255.0 as host$.example.com

Add following to /etc/bind/named.conf.local
zone "45.20.10.in-addr.arpa." {
        type master;
        file "/etc/bind/45.20.10.in-addr.arpa.zone";
};


Create the following file /etc/bind/45.20.10.in-addr.arpa.zone
$TTL    604800
@       IN      SOA     localhost. root.example.com. (
                              1         ; Serial
                         604800         ; Refresh
                          86400         ; Retry
                        2419200         ; Expire
                         604800 )       ; Negative Cache TTL
;
@       IN      NS      localhost.
$GENERATE 1-254 $      IN      PTR       host$.example.com 

Check the syntax using following command
sudo named-checkconf -z

Reload the server using following (though tests worked without doing it)
rndc reload

Test using following
host 10.20.45.7 localhost
host 10.20.45.37 localhost
host 10.20.45.73 localhost
