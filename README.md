## Notes
1st: 

Starting docker image.
Pam
Put firewall for TCP port and specific user
DNS zone example.com.
Apache server
Squid
Degrade a package
Ctrl + w , ctrl +alt + w wasn't working 

2nd: 

>Docker
create a docker with nginx:xxx 
docker was not installed

>udev
maybe: do somthing with /srv/xxxx
or maybe: create some drives

>systemd
fix issues with mysql without modifying configuration files

>Packaging
create deb package, tar was provided 

>samba
create filesystem 
create user xxxxx
allow that user

>git
clone a git repo from gitserver(didn't mention username) at /srv/xxx, ssh has been configured correctly, to /anther/location
then do bunch of stuff using git

>squid
install squid and configure it to take configuration from squid-upstream and then maybe clone to squid-downstream

>kernel/random question
there's a kernel in /srv/xxxx, make it bootable or installable at bootup. I did it using systemd. I used command to install dpkg --install ....
>rsyslog
install and enable and someother stuff

>partition
create volume group vgx using /dev/xxx /dev/xxx /dev/xxx with 500 MB. 
create ...... with slicing 5MB. 
total of two questions

>pam
configure pam ssh so that if user tries to login 5 time, it gets refused

>Database

>Openldap
looks like ldap server was already installed. kind of exercise provided by linuxacademy.com

>Firewall
i)this one may not have to be done using firewall -> disallow user charlie to get or maybe send at tcp/portxxx on computer xxxxx. 
ii) route traffic from port xxx at internet interface to ip address xx.x.x.x at port xx 

>LXC
it was mentioned they were using lxc for all the machines in the beginning. Create lxc Fxxxx and clone Gxxxx and with or something related to /srv/xxx
maybe also boot + not boot with these lxc images
